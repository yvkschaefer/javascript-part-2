/** Q1. Create a file called `warriors.js`, then, do the following. Commit and push as often as 
    you like so that we can monitor the progress of your code in the pull request.
  * Create a constructor function called `Warrior` that can create new warriors. This function 
    will take parameters `name`, and `gender`. `name` can be any string, `gender` can be `M` 
    or `F`. It should create a warrior that has these properties:
    * `name`: the value that was passed to the constructor
    * `gender`: the value that was passed to the constructor
    * `level`: 1
    * `weapon`: wooden sword
    * `power`: a random number between 1 and 100
  * In addition to that, every object that gets created should have the following methods:
    * `fight`: will output to the console: "<name> rushes to the arena with <his/her> <weapon>"
    * `faceoff`: faceoff takes one argument called `opponent`. Based on the `power` of each 
        opponent, this method should output to the console which player won the fight based on 
        their power. Be as creative as you like with the text of this method :)
  * Finally, create a bunch of warriors and make them fight together.*/
