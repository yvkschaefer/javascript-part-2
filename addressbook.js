/**Q2.Create a constructor function called `Person` that can create new persons. It takes 
    `firstName` and `lastName` as arguments, and assigns them to the new object. In addition to 
    that, the constructor function will assign each person an `emails` property that will be an 
    empty array.
  * Create a constructor function called `Email` that can create a new email address. It takes 
    `address` and `type` as arguments. It will assign `address` to the new object. For `type`, 
    check if it's in the list (work, home, other). If it's not in the list, set the type to "other".
  * Add an `addEmail` function to the *prototype of `Person`*. This function will be available to 
    all objects created using `new Person`. The `addEmail` function should take an email address 
    and type as arguments, call the `Email` constructor to create a new email object, then *`push`*
    that email object to the `emails` of the person.
  * Finally test your code by creating a person and giving them a home and work email.*/
